# Predictive-Maintenance-Using-MLIB-on-Databricks

In this project, the Databricks platform was strategically employed to facilitate the training of a predictive model for a manufacturing company. The primary objective was to leverage vibration sensor data to monitor machinery within their production line and accurately classify instances of potential faults. Notably, the developed predictive model achieved a commendable accuracy rate of over 90%.

To enhance the model's performance, a systematic approach was adopted, involving multiple runs with distinct hyperparameter configurations. Four prominent classification algorithms were implemented and evaluated for their efficacy in this context. These algorithms encompassed Decision Tree, Support Vector, Logistic Regression Machine, GBT Classifier,  and Random Forest Classifiers.

This comprehensive exploration of hyperparameter variations and algorithmic choices underscores the meticulous methodology applied in crafting a robust and accurate predictive model tailored to the unique needs of the manufacturing company.
